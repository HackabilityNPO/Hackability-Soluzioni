La biscotte ergonomique


## Detailed Description

La biscotte ergonomique

Panoramica del Progetto

The name Kiro comes from the prefix "chiro", coming from the ancient Greek kheír ("hand"). The shapes of the Kiro crackers have been thought through and tested to facilitate handling for users with certain gripping difficulties. Usually, the shapes of rusks and other crackers are designed according to production machines or aesthetic or marketing criteria. Kiro's variations have been imagined to adapt to the human and in the first place to the ergonomics of the hand. The Kiro Ro ’cracker can be broken in two along a pre-cut line: a rounded part is ready to be decorated with toppings and a smaller part which can be used as a spreading tool. This version offers a playful and practical cookie, with a practical dimension. The Kiro Rec ’crackers offer several handling possibilities thanks to their intuitive use in order to offer maximum comfort to each user according to their mobility and habits. All versions of Kiro crackers are made from cookie cutters. These can be made for “domestic” use with a 3D printer.

Documentazione Dettagliata

A team of designers and users worked for two fascinating days to imagine and conceive with Harrys and Wasa the accessibility of the kitchen and in particular rusks.



We applied the design thinking methodology during the workshop, as well as throughout the development phase of the project.The first step was to do an exercise to better understand the daily life of Claire &amp; Rivka and their relationship to cooking and food.We tried to understand their real need to define our goal.We focused on the moments when there is physical contact with the product and the difficulties that arise for them.



We worked to respond to the concerns encountered by Claire and Rebecca. Claire has tremors in her hands which make it difficult for her to hold on to certain things for a long time. After talking to them at length and observing their gestures during the two days of work at Barilla, we established several proposals and invited Claire and Rebecca to come and try them and give us their opinion.





After blind tests and letting our guests naturally take hold of the different rusks, we were able to focus on two forms that they found effective.

Guida Passo-Passo

1. La biscotte Kiro Ro’

Download the technical sheet of the Kiro Ro 'cookie cutter for 3D printing on the Hackability website.

Perform 3D printing with a 1.75mm PLA diameter food filament that you can find on the internet.



2. Recipe and ingredients



Prepare the ingredients (according to your taste) for the rusk.

An example of a recipe with a turmeric flavor

- Rye flour
- Wheat flour
- Olive oil
- Turmeric / ginger / black pepper / salt
- Water



Prepare the tools.

Mix all the ingredients in a container until a homogeneous paste is obtained.

Let the dough rest for 30 min.

3. Cooking

Roll out the dough with a roller on the work surface.

Cut the dough with the Kiro Ro cookie cutter.



Preheat the oven to 180 ° C, bake the rusks for 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let the rusks cool for 20 minutes.

4. Forms and uses

The pre-cut line on the cracker allows it to be separated into two parts for easier handling.

The smallest piece can thus be used to spread the rusk, adding a playful side to its use.



The shape of the rusk allows it to be dipped in containers of different shapes and sizes (mugs, cups, bowls, etc.).

You can also use the small piece as a spoon to mix.



The wave pattern allows you to eat in different ways.

The drawn curves are reminiscent of the ear of wheat.

5. La biscotte Kiro Rec’

6. Recipe and ingredients



Prepare the ingredients (according to your taste) for the rusk.

An example of a recipe with a salty taste:

- Rye flour
- Wheat flour
- Olive oil
- Charcoal / rosemary / cumin / garlic / coarse salt
- Sesame / squash kernels / flax kernels / sunflower kernels
- Water



Prepare the tools.

Mix all the ingredients in a container until a homogeneous paste is obtained.

Let the dough rest for 30 min.

7. Cooking



[Kiro rectangle git](https://youtu.be/AaoEJJzZW0c)

Roll out the dough on a work surface.

Cut the dough with the Kiro Rec ’cookie cutter.



Preheat the oven to 180 ° C, bake the rusks for 12 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let the rusks cool for 20 minutes.

8. Forms and uses



The shape of the Kiro Rec ’cookie is specially designed to make it easier to hold. Its curved lines perfectly match the muscles of the hand regardless of the grip chosen.



The width of the rusk has been precisely calculated to make 5 cm in order to adapt to all mouths and allow it to be eaten more easily. The drawn curves are reminiscent of the ear of wheat.
